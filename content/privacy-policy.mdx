**Last Updated: [Date]**

**[Your Company Name, Inc.]** ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information ("Personal Data") when you use our Service.

By using the Service, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.

### 1. How We Use Your Personal Data

We process your data for specific purposes to operate and secure our Service.

**A. Data You Provide or Authorize:**
- **Profile Data:** When you create an account, we may process your name, age, gender, email address, and profile picture. If you register using a social profile (e.g., Facebook), we may access authorized information like your name, gender, age, email, and photos to create your profile.
- **Correspondence Data:** We process information you provide when you contact us for support or other inquiries, including the content of your communications.
- **Transaction Data:** If you make purchases, we process transaction details, including contact and payment information, to supply the purchased services and keep records.

**B. Data Collected During Service Use:**
- **Usage Data:** We process data about your use of the service, including IP address, geographical location (country/state), browser type, operating system, and information about the timing, frequency, and pattern of your use.
- **Client Data:** We may process information about your device, such as your IP address, browser type and capabilities, operating system, and hardware details (e.g., device manufacturer and model).
- **Message Data:** We process the text messages you send through our service to enable their transfer and to administer the service. We do not retain complete message logs.
- **Ban and Complaint Data:** If you are banned or reported, we process data related to the violation. This may include elements of your usage/client data and **an image of the video frame (screenshot) from your video source** at the time of the violation. This data is used to enforce our rules and maintain platform safety.

### 2. Peer-to-Peer Connections

Our service may require a direct peer-to-peer connection between your computer and another user's computer. To establish this connection, it is necessary to make your IP address available to the other user's computer. This is a fundamental part of how peer-to-peer systems function, though your IP address is not displayed in the service's interface.

### 3. Sharing Your Personal Data

We only share your data in the following circumstances:
- **With Other Users:** We display your public profile information (name, age, gender, location) to other users as part of the Service.
- **With Service Providers:** Financial transactions are handled by our payment providers (e.g., PayPal, Apple, Google). We share transaction data only as necessary to process payments and handle queries. We may also use providers for hosting and analytics.
- **For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose your data to comply with a legal obligation, to protect vital interests, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. This includes cooperating with law enforcement. We may also disclose data to our insurers or professional advisers as necessary for managing risks or obtaining advice.

### 4. Data Retention and Deletion

We do not keep Personal Data for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.
- **Profile Data:** We retain your profile as long as your account is active.
- **Ban Data:** We retain ban data, including the screenshot, as long as necessary to maintain the ban. After the ban expires, we may keep a record of the ban but will not keep the user image.
- **Message Data:** We do not store your full message history.
- **Account Deletion:** You may request to delete your account through the Service. Upon request, your account will become publicly inaccessible and associated data will be physically deleted from our servers after a 30-day grace period.

### 5. Data Security

We employ modern technical and physical measures, such as firewalls and SSL encryption, to protect your Personal Data. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### 6. Children's Privacy

Our Service is not intended for anyone under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect data from minors. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a user under 18, we will deactivate their profile and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.

### 7. Cookies and Analytics

We use cookies for authentication and analysis. We use services like Google Analytics to analyze website use. Our service providers may also use cookies. You can manage cookies through your browser settings, but blocking them may impact the functionality of our Service.

### 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time by publishing a new version on our website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes.
