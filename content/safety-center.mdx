# Yea.cool Safety Center

Your safety is our top priority. This page provides information about our safety tools, policies, and resources to help you have a safe and positive experience on Yea.cool.

### Our Commitment to Safety

We are dedicated to building a community where users can connect authentically and without fear. We have a zero-tolerance policy for harmful content and behavior, including bullying, harassment, hate speech, and any form of child exploitation.

### Our Safety Features

**1. 24/7 Moderation**
- We employ a combination of state-of-the-art AI technology and a dedicated team of human moderators who work around the clock to review content and user reports.
- Users who violate our policies are removed from the platform.

**2. In-App Reporting**
- **How It Works:** If you encounter a user or content that violates our Community Guidelines, please report it immediately. When you submit a report, our moderators receive a screenshot of the violator's video and any messages they sent to help assess the situation accurately.
- **Confidentiality:** All reports are confidential. The person you report will not know who reported them.

**3. Automatic Ban System**
- Our system automatically bans users who receive multiple complaints from different people in a short period. This helps us quickly identify and remove repeat violators.

**4. Law Enforcement Cooperation**
- We actively cooperate with law enforcement agencies worldwide.
- We have a zero-tolerance policy for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and report all such incidents to the **National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)** as required by law.

### Tips for Staying Safe

- **Protect Your Personal Information:** Avoid sharing private details like your full name, address, phone number, or financial information. Be mindful of what might be visible in your background.
- **Think Before You Act:** If another user asks you to do something that might violate the rules, don't do it. It is in your best interest to avoid being provoked into an action that could get you banned.
- **Don't Retaliate, Just Report:** If someone is offensive, the correct response is to report them, not to be offensive back. Retaliating could make you a violator, too.
- **Block Freely:** If someone makes you feel uncomfortable for any reason, use the "Block" feature to prevent them from contacting you again.
- **Be Wary of Offline Meetings:** Be extremely cautious if you consider meeting someone in person whom you've only met online.

### Get Help and Support

If you or someone you know is in crisis or needs support, you are not alone. Here are some resources that can help:

- **For Immediate Danger:** If you believe you or someone else is in immediate danger, contact your local law enforcement or emergency services right away.
- **Crisis Text Line (U.S.):** Text HELLO to 741741 to connect with a trained crisis counselor. This service is free, confidential, and available 24/7.
- **StopNCII.org:** If you are over 18 and concerned that your intimate images have been shared online without your consent, StopNCII.org can help prevent them from being re-shared on participating platforms.
- **Take It Down (NCMEC):** If you are under 18 (or an adult concerned about images from when you were a minor), Take It Down helps you remove explicit images of yourself from the internet.

Your safety is a shared responsibility. Thank you for helping us keep Yea.cool a welcoming place for everyone.
