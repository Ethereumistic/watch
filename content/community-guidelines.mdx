# Yea.cool Community Guidelines

**Last Updated: [Date]**

Welcome to the Yea.cool community! Our mission is to create a fun, safe, and respectful environment. To achieve this, all users must follow these guidelines. Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban from our Service.

### 1. Be Respectful

Treat others with kindness and respect. Bullying, insults, rude behavior, and threats are forbidden. We have zero tolerance for discrimination based on race, religion, nationality, gender, age, or appearance.

### 2. Age Restriction: You Must Be 18+

- Our Service is strictly for adults.
- Do not use the service if you are under 18.
- Do not create content that features anyone under 18.
- Reporting a minor you encounter is mandatory for community safety.

### 3. No Nudity or Sexually Explicit Content

This is not a place for sexual content. The following are strictly prohibited:
- Appearing naked, in underwear, or with a naked torso.
- Pointing the camera at intimate body parts or any part of the body below the chest, even if clothed.
- Exposing intimate body parts (genitals, buttocks, female nipples).
- Making obscene gestures (e.g., the middle finger) or sexually suggestive gestures (e.g., licking lips, touching intimate parts).
- Using sexually provocative language, slang (e.g., "cock," "pussy"), or sexually suggestive emojis.
- Proposing "virtual sex" or asking others to undress.

### 4. No Inappropriate or Unrelated Video Content

Keep the camera on your face. It is forbidden to:
- Direct the camera at a TV, computer screen, phone, or any other display. This includes streaming video games.
- Show photos, illustrations, or text instead of your live video.
- Use webcam emulators, software filters, visual effects, or avatars to alter or hide your live video stream.

### 5. No Harassment, Hate Speech, or Violent Content

- Do not harass, bully, stalk, or intimidate others.
- Do not use hate speech or engage in racism, sexism, or homophobia.
- Do not threaten violence or promote self-harm.
- Content depicting severe drug abuse or other illegal acts is forbidden.

### 6. No Spam, Advertising, or Solicitation

- Do not display promotional content or send advertising messages.
- Do not send links to social profiles or other websites.
- Do not ask other users to like, subscribe, or perform other online actions.
- Do not create fake accounts or send unsolicited emails.

### 7. General Conduct

- **No Impersonation:** Do not pretend to be another person.
- **Keep Your Face Visible:** Users want to see who they are talking to. Hiding your face is not allowed.
- **Chat in a Well-Lit Area:** Ensure you are clearly visible.
- **No Chatting in Bathrooms:** Using the video chat in a lavatory or bathroom is prohibited to avoid misinterpretation.
- **You Are Responsible:** You are responsible for all activity from your device, even if a friend or relative is using it.
- **Do Not Retaliate:** If another user violates the rules, report them. Do not respond with a violation of your own, as this could also get you banned.

### Reporting Violations

If you see someone violating these guidelines, report them immediately using the in-app reporting tools. Our moderators review complaints 24/7. When you report someone, our moderators receive a screenshot of their video to review the violation.
