You are an expert senior software engineer specializing in modern web development (frontend & backend), with deep expertise in TypeScript, Next JS 15, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, Socket.io, WebRTC, UDP protocol, Supabase and its S3 storage. You are thoughtful, precise, and focus on delivering high-quality, maintainable solutions. We have that document about a MVP product and your job is to create a highly detailed dev assignment. Here it is: 

## Software Product Prompt: Lightning Roulette

**1. Project Title:** Watch

**2. Target Audience:**

- Individuals interested in, real-time video chat.
- Individuals wanting to meet strangers.
- Users seeking a new social network platform that brings the real out.

**3. Problem Statement:**

- Current online video chat platforms often rely on poor moderation, old tech stacks and boring experience.
- No mini-games inside of their platforms that make user experience more fun and better.

**4. Proposed Solution:**

- Video chat platform leveraging WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication and MediaSoup for group calls, streaming etc.
- Utilize Supabase for user authentication, profile management.

**5. Functional Requirements:**

- **Video Chat Functionality:**
    - Implement WebRTC for real-time peer-to-peer video and audio communication.
    - Use [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) for signaling and connection management
    - Use MediaSoup for superior video handling, more than 2 users in a room (trio or even more).
    - Enable random matching of users, and robust algorithms for that.
    - Implement immediate skip and next buttons.
    - give ability to users to add each other to their friend lists

**6. Non-Functional Requirements:**

- **Performance:**
    - Minimize latency in video and audio communication.
- **Security:**
    - Protect user privacy and data security.
    - Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Protect against sybil attacks.
- **Usability:**
    - Provide a clean and intuitive user interface using shadcn ui.
    - Ensure easy navigation and accessibility.
- **Reliability:**
    - Maintain high uptime and availability.
    - Implement robust error handling.

**7. Technical Requirements:**

- **Techstack:**
    - Next JS
    - TypeScript
    - Tailwind CSS + ShadCN-UI
    - WebRTC
    - [Socket.io](http://socket.io/)
    - MediaSoup
    - zustand
    - Supabase

- **Database:**
    - Supabase and its S3 storage for profile pictures.
- **Lightning Network:**
    - Lightning Network protocol
- **Deployment:**
    - Cloud-based deployment (e.g., VPS).

**8. Mockups/Wireframes:**

- Design wireframes for the user interface, including login, profile setup, video chat, and wallet management.

**9. Success Metrics:**

- User adoption rate.
- Number of active users.
- Volume of Lightning Network transactions.
- User satisfaction and feedback.
- Uptime.
- Amount of sats within the platform.

**10. Constraints:**

- Time constraints for MVP development.
- Budget constraints for infrastructure and services.
- Potential limitations of WebRTC, [socket.io](http://socket.io) and MediaSoup

**11. Future Considerations:**

- Implement text chat.
- Add features for user moderation and reporting.
